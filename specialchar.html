	<h1>Don't be afraid to be &lt; a 100% success &amp; more&gt;</h1>
	<p>
		&quot;Arise, awake and do not stop until the goal is reached.

		You have to grow from the inside out. None can teach you, none can make you spritual. There is no other teacher but your own soul. 

		You&nbsp;cannot&nbsp;believe&nbsp;in&nbsp;GOD&nbsp;until&nbsp;you&nbsp;believe&nbsp;in&nbsp;yourself. 

		We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what your think. Words are secondary. Thoughts live; they travel far.

		All the powers in the universe are already ours. It is we who have put our hands before our eyes and cry that it is dark.

		The world is a great gymnasium where we come to make ourselves strong. 

		External nature is only internal nature writ large. 

		All differences in this world are of degree, and not of kind, because oneness is the secret of everything. 

		Truth can be stated in a thousand different ways, yet each one can be true. 

		If money help a man to do good to others, it is of some value; but if not; it is simply a mass of evil, and the sooner it is got rid of, the better.&quot;
